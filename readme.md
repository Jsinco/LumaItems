Personal project which I use for custom items on my minecraft server.

Some things you'll find here:
- Custom items are divided up by their individual classes for their unique abilities.
- Events are fired when the item is used
- Custom item classes are automatically instantiated at runtime requiring the developer to do nothing but create the class for the custom item and immediately get to writing.
